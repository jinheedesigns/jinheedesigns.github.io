                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>There is a growing concern at Cal Lutheran University of whether their multimedia students are connected to all the resources they need to succeed in their careers once they graduate.</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                    <p>An online platform that makes career resources easily accessible for multimedia students, hence encouraging students to become involved in career preparation earlier on in their college education. </p>
                    <h3>The Why</h3>
                    <p>The career development process for multimedia students at Cal Lutheran University can be especially challenging because multimedia is a wide and constantly evolving career field, with each niche area requiring a very specific set of skills, portfolios, and work experiences. Hence, a big challenge for the school is making sure their multimedia graduates are fully equipped and prepared to meet current employee expectations to succeed in the real world.<br>
                    In particular, an important question that arose was, “Do they have access to all the resources they need to successfully jump start their career?”</p>

                <h2>Research Summary</h2>
                <p>While many career resources are available to multimedia students at CLU, they still struggle to achieve career readiness. Research shows that the increased mental burden in navigating the multitude of steps and facets involved in career development can be a deterrence. Hence, the process needs to be simplified for students.</p>
